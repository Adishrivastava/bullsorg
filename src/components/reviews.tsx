      review: 'I started my stock market journey 5months ago and since then, Bullsorg team stood by my side. Instead of just making money, they taught me the ins and outs of the market. They provided me with knowledge and platform to build a strong foundation. You got personal financial issues, have fundamental doubts or need technical analysis? They got you. The whole team is very cooperative and responsive, quick in communication, they donâ€™t keep you waiting. '
